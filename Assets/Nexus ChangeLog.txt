Version 1.00.00

Full release (I'm not really sure if SKSE64 is actually out of beta now, but what the hell :p)

On-screen widgets should update when equipping/unequipping weapons (eg using SkyUI hotkeys)

Better handling of the situation where the mod cannot identify the opened container (this definitely happens with Ash Piles/Ghostly remains - there may be others).  Now, instead of throwing a message and preventing all functions, it should continue to work for items in the player's inventory.


Version 0.01.01

Bumped max Charge Multiplier val to 25

Added a workaround for the mod not recognising player-created poisons/potions after the first hotkey press


Version 0.01.00

Initial release (alpha version, tracking SKSE64's alpha state)
